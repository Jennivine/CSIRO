# CSIRO

This folder contains all my code writting during a week of work experience at CSIRO Data61.

It uses a programming language called daml, which has its documentations at:
https://docs.daml.com/index.html

To run the code, download daml SDK, then manually change the 'source' in the daml.yaml file to local file path. Compile using the command "daml start"
