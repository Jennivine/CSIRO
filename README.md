# CSIRO

This folder contains all my code written during a week of work experience at CSIRO Data61.

It uses a programming language called daml, which has its documentations at:
https://docs.daml.com/index.html

To run the code, download daml SDK, then manually change the 'source' in the daml.yaml file to the local file path. Open terminal and type in the command "daml init" so that the daml assistant will recognise the root folder as a project folder. Compile using the command "daml start".
